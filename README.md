Implementation of filter feature selection methods for text data, compare and visualize results of them - Python Code

First, we load and clean text data. Then we use Gini, Correlation, Odds_Ratio, Information_Gain, Document_Frequency, and DFS for select features and finally train and predict with Gaussian Naive Base, DecisionTree Classifier, MLPClassifier, and SVM.
